    <h1>Analyzing Music Preferences and Listening Habits â€“ Survey Findings</h1>
    <p>Music is a part of our everyday lives, affecting emotions, work productivity, and social interactions. This page summarizes the results of a survey researching music preferences, listening habits, and what affects musical choices.</p>

    <h2>1. ðŸŽ¸Favorite Music Genres</h2>
    <p>Popular genres include Pop, Classical, Hip-hop/Rap, Electronic, Jazz, and Folk. It can be seen that most of the respondents prefer a combination of genres, which reflects varied musical tastes instead of strict loyalty to one category.</p>
    <div class="chart-container">
        <canvas id="genresChart"></canvas>
    </div>

    <h2>2. ðŸŽ¤Favorite Artists and Bands</h2>
    <p>The respondents gave a diverse list of favorite artists, ranging from globally known artists like Taylor Swift, Coldplay, Bruno Mars, and Sonu Nigam. The presence of different artists indicates that musical tastes are influenced by both global and local factors. The presence of both classical and contemporary artists indicates a taste for both new and old music.</p>

    </div>

    <h2>3. ðŸ“ˆFactors Influencing Music Choices</h2>
    <p>When questioned about what most affects their music selection, the respondents stated:
Mood â€“ A major influence on what kind of music they listen to at any particular time.
Lyrics â€“ Most of the participants enjoy substantial and poetic lyrics.

    </div>

    <h2>4. Preference for Songs vs. Albums</h2>
    <p>Most of the respondents prefer to listen to individual songs rather than full albums. This supports current streaming behavior, where playlists and random tracks are prevalent. But a few respondents like the tightness of full albums, demonstrating that traditional album listening continues to have merit.</p>
